# Early-Diabetic-Foot-Ulcer-Detection-using-Thermograms

Diabetic foot is a common complication associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) leading to ulcerations in 
the feet. Due to diabetic neuropathy, most patients have reduced sensitivity to pain. As a result, minor injuries go 
unnoticed and progress into ulcers. The timely detection of potential ulceration points and intervention is crucial in 
preventing amputation. Changes in plantar temperature are one of the early signs of ulceration.

I used the below mentioned paper as a reference [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362979390_Holistic_multiclass_classification_grading_of_diabetic_foot_ulcerations_from_plantar_thermal_images_using_deep_learning]

Using the above custom neural network I was able to get aroung 98% training accuracy and 96% test accuracy.
